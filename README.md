# SpookyBallisticsEXP

Advanced combat, stance, and movement systems for **Project Zomboid (Build 41.78)**.

This mod focuses on replacing or augmenting vanilla combat feel with:
- Aim-relative movement
- Velocity burst movement
- Custom stances (canted, unarmed, etc.)
- Animation-driven mechanics
- Multiplayer-aware state handling

The project intentionally avoids heavy reliance on vanilla pathing/actions where possible.

---

It currently depends on two pre-existing mods, but is likely to replace them.

- Fancy/Brutal Handwork
- Advanced Trajectory

## Project Goals

- Responsive, animation-driven combat
- Clear separation of client / server / shared logic
- Multiplayer correctness over visual shortcuts
- Remain optimized while pushing the PZ engine to its limits, replicating modern systems seen in games like Dark Souls.

## IMPORTANT

- We only use proven methods for B41.78
